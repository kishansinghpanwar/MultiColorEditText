# Multi Color EditText (Project Under Development)
EditText with power of write in multiple colors.

### "Necessity is the mother of invention"

Some days back, I thought to create a notebook app where users can write in multiple colors, but didn't find any solution where I could do this using Android Native Edit Text.
And I got this idea to create something different, and this is the MultiColorEditText.
The project is under development. I would like if you would suggest anything about this.
